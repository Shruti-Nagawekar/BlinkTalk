# BlinkTalk
BlinkTalk is a computer vision project designed to help quadriplegic patients communicate by detecting eye blinks and translating them into Morse code, which is then converted into English text.

## Features

- Real-time eye blink detection using a webcam.
- Translation of eye blinks into Morse code.
- Conversion of Morse code into English text.
- Visual feedback on detected Morse code and translated text.

## Technologies

- Python
- OpenCV
- Dlib
- Scipy
- Numpy

## Note

The program will start the webcam feed. Blink to input Morse code:
    - Short blink for `.` (dot)
    - Long blink for `-` (dash)
